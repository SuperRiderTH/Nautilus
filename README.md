# Nautilus
Developed by Nemo starting in 2013 and continuing till present time (as of this writing, February 24, 2024).

Initially a tool suite to create, edit and work with Rock Band files, now it works with some files from other rhythm games.
Check out the many buttons and see if it'll do what you need. Most features have a Help document but unfortunately I haven't kept up with updating them. Hopefully whoever starts working on this updates the Help documents.

Nautilus wouldn't be possible without the groundwork and assistance of others, so let's get into it.
